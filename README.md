## Byte-Sized RSE: Unit Testing Code

This is a Byte-Sized RSE lesson on unit testing code, part of the [Byte-Sized RSE Series](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/byte-sized-rse-overview/tree/main).

### Questions

- What is a unit test, and why is it important for improving the reliability and reproducibility of research code?
- How can we identify which parts of code should be tested?
- How do we write and run a simple unit test for a given function?
- How can we test that code handles errors or invalid inputs correctly?
- What makes a good, maintainable unit test?

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, learners should be able to:

- Describe what unit testing is and explain why it matters for software quality.
- Examine example code and identify where and how unit tests could be applied.
- Write a simple unit test for a function and integrate it into their project.
- Recognise common error/exception conditions in code and write tests that handle/expect such errors.
- Evaluate a test suite in terms of coverage.
